The Collection interface is a member of the Java Collections Framework. 
It is a part of java.util package. It is one of the root interfaces of the Collection Hierarchy. 
The Collection interface is not directly implemented by any class. However, 
it is implemented indirectly via its subtypes or subinterfaces like List, Queue, and Set. 

For Example, the HashSet class implements the Set interface which is a subinterface of the Collection interface.
